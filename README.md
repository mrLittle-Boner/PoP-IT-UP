# Tax Deduction
There is source code of this "project";

You can check online version on github pages [here](https://mrlittle-boner.github.io/popit/index.html);

But there some issues with build version (fonts go away);

## Instalation
But! You can check dev version in your machine!

1. Clone/Download repo;
2. Install dependencies;
3. Use "run serve" script to start live server;

P.S. It seems ugly and it can be refactor and i`ll do it later but for now it works;

P.S.S Have a nice day! :wave:
